# Russo-Japanese Propaganda

This curation is part of the MAP701 course at the University of Kentucky. It features Kisaburo Ohara's <i>A Humorous Diplomatic Atlas of Europe and Asia</i>,
a propaganda map made in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War. This project utilizes HTML and JavaScript (JQuery, Leaflet) to take the viewer on a guided tour,
exploring Ohara's work with themes learned in MAP701.
